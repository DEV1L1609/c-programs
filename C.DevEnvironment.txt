#C Development Environment

 
There are 6 main phases in c program:

1.Edit

2.Preprocess

3.Compile

4.Link

5.Load 

6.Execute



Based on Fig.1.1:

Fig.1.1 is represents the typical C development Environment.
It explains the various phases of the environment using pictorial representation.

Phase 1: This phase explains the creation of the program. The programmer creates a new program using editors.
             This program is stored on the disk.
Vi and Emacs are a few widely used editor programs to run C programming Languages. 
             The C program is always saved by using the extension ".c".

Phase 2: In this phase the compilation process is inititated by the programmer.
             The preprocessor runs the compilation and processes the code.
             It follows predefined directives and precomiles even before this phase begins.

Phase 3: In this phase the compiler translates the converts the C program into machine level language.
             The object code is created and stored on the disk.

Phase 4:This phase is executed to link functions defined elsewhere.
             The linker links the object code with the codde to produce executable image.

Phase 5: In this phase the program is placed into the memory by the loader. 
             The executable image along with components of the shared libraries are transferred to the memory.

Phase 6: This is the final phase in which the CPU executes the instructions line by line.
